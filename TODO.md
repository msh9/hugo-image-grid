# Before next feature
- Improve rendering on list/section pages and home page when useFeaturedImage is enabled. Right now galleries are rendered vertically stacked due to use of <section>

# Next feature
Implement use of <picture> element to support user agent aware delivery of different formats. Primarily content size and format (between jpb and avif). This implementation may possibly replace the existing thumbnail implementation.
